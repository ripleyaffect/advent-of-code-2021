This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project

## Running the app

```
npm run dev
```

## Solutions

Solutions will become available from the api as they're completed

For a particular day's solution, you can visit

```
localhost:3000/api/days/[DAY]
```

while the server is running. `[DAY]` is zero-padded on the left if the number is < 10, so day 1 is

```
localhost:3000/api/days/01
```
